# Research Experiences

## Final Year Project

### [Numerical Modelling of Flexible Heat Pipes in Space Applications](https://github.com/gokulraj-m02/gokulraj-m02/blob/main/Research%20Experience/Numerical%20Modelling%20of%20Flexible%20Heat%20Pipes%20in%20Space%20Applications.md)
üìç *National Institute of Technology Tiruchirappalli*  
- Developed a numerical model for the design and analysis of flexible heat pipes for space applications.  
- Designed heat pipe geometries with various bending angles to analyze thermal efficiencies.  
- Evaluated thermal capabilities such as conductivity across different input powers and infill ratios.

## Internships

### [Fluid-Structure Interaction of Flexible beams using SPH](https://github.com/gokulraj-m02/gokulraj-m02/blob/main/Research%20Experience/Fluid-Structure%20Interaction%20of%20Flexible%20beams%20using%20Smoothed-Particle%20Hydrodynamics.md)
üìç *University of Manchester*
- Performed Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) analysis of flexible beams using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH).  
- Investigated the behavior of slender and hyper-elastic material beams under fluid flow.  
- Validated the SPH model and assessed the impact of geometrical and material variations on beam deflection.

### [Integrated Camber and Twist Morphing wings for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles](https://github.com/gokulraj-m02/gokulraj-m02/blob/main/Research%20Experience/Integrated%20Camber%20and%20Twist%20Morphing%20Wing%20for%20Unmanned-Aerial%20Vehicles.md)
üìç *Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur*
- Researched morphing wing methodologies for fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).  
- Designed an integrated camber morphing wing using SolidWorks and conducted structural analysis in ANSYS.  
- Manufactured a wing rib using rapid prototyping methods to test and verify the practicality of the design.
