# Projects

## 1. [VTOL](https://github.com/gokulraj-m02/gokulraj-m02/blob/main/Projects/VTOL.md) 
*National Institute of Technology Tiruchirappalli*  
- Designed a Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) aerial vehicle with three different operational modes.  
- Integrated a tri-copter mechanism with a fixed-wing platform and designed the CAD model of the UAV.  
- Worked in the fabrication of the prototype and the testing phase of the model.

## 2. [SAE AeroTHON](https://github.com/gokulraj-m02/gokulraj-m02/blob/main/Projects/SAE%20AeroTHON%202022.md)
*SAE India*  
- Designed and fabricated a multi-rotor UAV capable of autonomously dropping a payload at a specified target location.  
- Involved in modeling the CAD of the UAV and carried out structural analysis for the entire structure.  
- Worked on the fabrication of carbon-fiber composite parts and successfully tested the prototype for payload delivery. 
- Developed an image processing algorithm to detect the target drop location autonomously.

## 3. [Crop Duster UAV](https://github.com/gokulraj-m02/gokulraj-m02/blob/main/Projects/Crop%20Duster%20UAV.md)
*National Institute of Technology Calicut*  
- Designed a twin-boom glider with a twin-propeller configuration for agricultural fertilizer application.  
- Performed wing analysis using XFLR5, designed the CAD model of fuselage, and carried out structural analysis.  
- Developed a liquid fertilizer deliver mechanism with a nozzle arrangement to maximize coverage area.

## 4. [Strawberry stacker](https://github.com/gokulraj-m02/gokulraj-m02/blob/main/Projects/Strawberry%20Stacker.md)
*National Institute of Technology Tiruchirappalli*  
- Developed a program to automate drones to collect packages in strawberry field and transport them to designated hub.
-	Programmed the autonomous search operation of drones and collection of boxes across the field using ROS.  
- Implemented image processing to detect strawberry boxes and validated the system in Gazebo simulation.
